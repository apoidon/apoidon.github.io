I"²<p>I followed the instructions for setting up a static website using Jekyll in the official <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-ste/01-setup">Step by Step Tutorial</a>. Found it to be one of the most straightforward guides which helped build an understanding or intuition on how everything is set up. For now this blog looks absolutely barren (strangely, I sort of like it). I havenâ€™t decided yet if Iâ€™m going to try using a Jekyll template (found some minimalist ones that I like) or leave this as is and start building this blogâ€™s CSS/JavaScript piece by piece.</p>

<p>Either way, Iâ€™ll be documenting the entire process here (and all my other personal projects too!).</p>
