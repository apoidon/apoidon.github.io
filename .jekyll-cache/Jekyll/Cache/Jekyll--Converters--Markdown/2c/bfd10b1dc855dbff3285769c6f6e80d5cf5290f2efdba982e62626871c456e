I"E<p>I followed the instructions for setting up a static website using Jekyll in the official <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-ste/01-setup">Step by Step Tutorial</a>. Found it to be one of the most straightforward guides which helped build an understanding or intuition on how everything is set up. For now this blog looks absolutely barren (strangely, I sort of like it). I haven’t decided yet if I’m going to try using a Jekyll template (found some minimalist ones that I like) or leave this as is and start building this blog’s CSS/JavaScript piece by piece.</p>
